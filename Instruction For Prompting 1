Prompt Question:

"I am developing an Automated Penetration Testing Web Application for my Final Year Project (FYP). All development is currently being done within a Kali Linux VM.

Here's what I have accomplished so far (Frontend):

    I have a web-based frontend built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript.

    This frontend (mainpage.html located at /home/kali/Documents/FYP Coding File/First Attempt/mainpage.html) currently provides a user interface with sections for 'Reconnaissance & Dorking', 'Device Scanning', and 'Web Scanning'.

    All functionalities in the current frontend are simulated (using setTimeout to show placeholder results), as shown in the provided Canvas.

Here's what I attempted and the challenges I faced (Backend Integration):

    My primary goal was to integrate actual penetration testing tools with this frontend.

    I attempted to set up a Python Flask backend (app.py in /home/kali/Documents/FYP Coding File/First Attempt/backend/) to communicate with the frontend and execute tools.

    I used a Python virtual environment (.venv) for managing dependencies.

    My first integration attempt was with the Sherlock OSINT tool (for username enumeration).

    I encountered persistent issues getting Sherlock to run reliably through the Flask backend, and even standalone in the terminal.

        Initial problem: Accidentally installed the wrong sherlock Python package (not the OSINT tool).

        After correcting to pip install sherlock-project, the tool still failed with a generic ERROR: Problem while attempting to access data file message.

        Troubleshooting involved: pip uninstall, pip install, source .venv/bin/activate, sudo chmod, sudo chown on data.json and its parent resources directory, and direct sherlock command tests with various arguments.

        Despite extensive troubleshooting, Sherlock could not be made to function correctly on my Kali VM setup.

    Due to these persistent issues, I have removed all backend-related files (backend directory, app.py, .venv) from my Kali VM and reverted the frontend mainpage.html to its purely simulated state (as seen in the current Canvas).

Here's what I want to achieve (Future Goals):

    I need to successfully integrate actual penetration testing tools (e.g., OSINT tools like Sherlock/PhoneInfoga, network scanners like Nmap, web vulnerability scanners like ZAP, or custom Python scripts) with my web frontend.

    The backend should automate the execution of these tools based on user input from the frontend.

    The results from these tools need to be captured and displayed in real-time within the web interface.

    Ultimately, the application should be able to generate comprehensive reports based on the findings.

Given this context, how can I best proceed with integrating real tools, or what alternative approaches/tools would you recommend for my automated penetration testing web application?"
