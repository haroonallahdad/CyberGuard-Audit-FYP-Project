Prompt for Explaining My Automated PenTest Web App Setup

"Hello! I'd like to provide a comprehensive overview of the automated penetration testing web application I've been developing. Here's a summary of the work completed and the current setup:

Project Overview & Current Status:
I'm building a web-based automated penetration testing platform. So far, I've established a full-stack application with a frontend and a backend, designed to integrate various OSINT and scanning tools.

Frontend Setup (mainpage.html):

    Developed the user interface using HTML, styled with Tailwind CSS, and interactive elements with JavaScript.

    It features a multi-page navigation system (Home, Reconnaissance & Dorking, Device Scanning, Web Scanning).

    The 'Reconnaissance & Dorking' section is currently functional and includes:

        An input field for 'Target Identifier' (for usernames or phone numbers).

        Two buttons: 'Perform OSINT Search' (for usernames) and 'Retrieve Contact Information' (for phone numbers).

        Robust client-side input validation and intelligent redirection logic:

            If a phone number is entered for username search, it prompts the user to use the 'Retrieve Contact Information' button.

            If a username is entered for phone number search, it prompts the user to use the 'Perform OSINT Search' button.

            It validates for correct username and international phone number formats (starting with +) and provides specific error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., special characters, wrong length).

        Improved UI/UX with professional button hover effects and clear placeholder text.

Backend Setup (app.py - Flask/Python):

    Built a Flask application (app.py) that acts as the central API gateway.

    It's configured with CORS to allow communication with the frontend.

    It has two primary API endpoints for reconnaissance:

        /api/recon/osint: This endpoint receives a username, executes a custom Python script (osint_checker.py) as a subprocess, captures its JSON output, and returns it to the frontend.

        /api/recon/phone: This new endpoint receives a phone number, executes another custom Python script (phone_tracker.py) as a subprocess, captures its JSON output, and sends it back to the frontend.

Custom OSINT Tools (Python Scripts):

    osint_checker.py: A standalone Python script that performs username enumeration across various platforms (e.g., social media sites). It outputs its findings in JSON format to standard output.

    phone_tracker.py: A newly developed Python script that uses the phonenumbers library to extract publicly available information about a phone number (country, carrier, timezones). It also includes simulated sections for associated accounts and location, as real-time, precise data for generic numbers isn't publicly available or ethical. It outputs its results in JSON format.

Environment:

    The entire setup runs within a dedicated Python virtual environment (.venv).

    All development and testing are being conducted on a Kali Linux VM.

Current Functionality:

    Users can enter a username and click 'Perform OSINT Search' to get real-time OSINT results from the backend.

    Users can enter a phone number (in international + format) and click 'Retrieve Contact Information' to get parsed phone number details (country, carrier, timezones) and simulated associated data from the backend.

    The frontend intelligently guides the user if they try to use the wrong button for their input type or if the input format is incorrect.

This is the current state of my project. I'm focused on ensuring robustness, user-friendliness, and ethical data handling."
